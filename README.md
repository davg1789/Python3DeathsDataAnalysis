# python3DeathsDataAnalysis
Python3, reads an Excel dataset, transforms the data, generates graphs and saves as images
- Dataset: Provisional counts of deaths by the week the deaths occurred, by state of occurrence, and by select underlying causes of death for 2020-2023. The dataset also includes weekly provisional counts of death for COVID-19, coded to ICD-10 code U07.1 as an underlying or multiple cause of death.
- The program groups the data by state and year and adds the causes of death by type of disease. Transform it into a line graph and save one image per state.
